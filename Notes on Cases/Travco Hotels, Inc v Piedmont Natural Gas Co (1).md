ANALYSIS: This case is part of a series of cases that was designated due to their relation to the Winston Salem Piedmont Natural Gas explosion. Footnote 1 tells us exactly what four factors were used to designate this case “…the number and diverse interests of the parties; ... the complexity of the evidentiary matters and legal issues involved; whether it will promote the efficient administration of justice; and such other matters as the Chief Justice shall deem appropriate….” The footnote also explains how a group of cases that are connected to an event can be designated as a group.

SUMMARY: Action arose from a natural gas explosion. The explosion destroyed property of Travco and K&W Cafeteria. Plaintiff Travco alleges that the explosion was caused by the negligence of Defendant Piedmont Natural Gas. Numerous suits were filed against Piedmont, and the cases in connection with the explosion were then designated as exceptional.

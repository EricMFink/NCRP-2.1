ANALYSIS: There are other ways a judge can be appointed to a case. It seems unclear based on the opinion whether this case was designated. However, this case does not need to be designated to have a different judge appointed to the case, but if it did, Judge conflict with the parties and knowledge of information about the case would very likely fall under “such other matters as the Chief Justice shall deem appropriate.” 

SUMMARY: Plaintiff Ex-Wife Lockert filed this action against Defendant Ex-Husband Lockert seeking an absolute divorce and equitable distribution of marital property. A judge from outside of the District was assigned as all other judges available in the district had some knowledge or relation to the case.

SUMMARY: Insurer/Plaintiff Home Indemnity Company brought this action Hoechest Celanese Corporation (along with two-scrolls worth of other indemnified defendant insurance/surety companies). Plaintiff is seeking a declaration that they had no responsibility to defend or indemnify its insured for their environmental liabilities (environmental contamination/pollution) occurring from sites in several states. There was an order entered putting a stay on litigation regarding pollution sites outside of NC, leaving only the 4 in NC relevant to the case at hand and causing the others to have to re-file in their respective states. The issue is whether the stay is allowed or is an abuse of discretion.

THEORY: Designation in this case occurred before the stay regarding NC v. out of state contamination cases. Because of that, I think it possible that the case may have been designated in an effort to promote the efficient administration of justice/for judicial efficiency. Should that not be the case, an argument could be made that the case was designated because of the complicated legal/factual issues and need for an expert on the subject, but I think this is less likely as the facts seem pretty straightforward therefore making it more conceivable that the case was designated for efficiency.

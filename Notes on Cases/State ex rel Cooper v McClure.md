# State ex rel. Cooper v. McClure

Cite: 2007 WL 2570249, *1
Court: N.C.Super.
Issued Date: July 19, 2007
Reviewed: Yes

1: “The case was designated “exceptional” under [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1006366&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=Ic66ca0415d6511dc8200d0063168b01f&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e3e919af24794dd38b8064d489c20f39&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)) and assigned to the undersigned Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina dated August 11, 2003.” 

Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant’s Request for Rule 2.1 Recommendation 2003 WL 24045477: Plaintiff argues that this case does not raise any complex business issue. There is mention of the “filled rate doctrine” previously noted in *Novo Nordisk Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. v. Carolina Power & Light Co.* The argument for designation from the State is that designation as “exceptional” would promote the efficient administration of justice, is in anticipation of extensive pretrial discovery, and the want for an judge experienced in the area.

ANALYSIS: Taking from the Plaintiff’s Response… it seems this case was designated through a combination of two factors: Promotion of efficient administration of justice and extensive pretrial discovery and motions. There is no clear connection in the Plaintiff’s Response… showing how the facts represent those factors. But considering the presence of the State and government agencies involved, and previous cases where that involvement has promoted designation, it may be the presence of such which is used for the “efficient administration of justice” factor. 

SUMMARY: DENR sets specific rates for environmental services and publishes those rates in the RRD. DENR then solicits environmental consultants for billing rates to determine the reimbursement costs. In 2001 DENR published potential revisions to RRD. In response to the revisions, environmental consultants collected and eventually created NCESPA. The State alleges that Defendants took two actions to cause the DENR to raise the rates in the RRD. First being false billing information and the second being improperly influencing the prices for State led work.

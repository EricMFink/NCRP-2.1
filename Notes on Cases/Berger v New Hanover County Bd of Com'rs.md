SUMMARY: Plaintiff Berger was elected to serve a 4 year term on New Hanover’s Board of Commissioners. The Board adopted a petition to remove Berger from the Board. Berger filed a complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

THEORY: The opinion is very bare bones. The main issues are whether the Board could have removed Berger using the “Amotion” process, whether Berger’s Due Process rights were violated during the “Amotion” process, and does this court (NC Superior) have the jurisdiction to hear this case on Writ of Cert. or Appeal? A large portion of the issues stems from whether the use of alternative evidence rules created a fault in the Amotion proceedings. I believe this case was designated because of the complicated issues, pre-trial proceedings, and possible complications with discovery.

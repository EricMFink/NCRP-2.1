SUMMARY: Taxpayers filed suit with a class action against the State and Secretary of Revenue challenging the constitutionality of a temporary income tax raise. Taxpayers are seeking refunds of their income tax payments. The issue is whether the prohibition of the state constitution prohibiting a retrospective tax applies to mid-year tax increase on income.

THEORY: Two things that are not factors point to designation: Class Certification (number/diverse interests of parties?) and presence of a State government/government adjacent agency as a party. While these are not factors, they seem to be common threads between other designated cases. Because of this, the case at issue may have been designated to promote judicial efficiency.

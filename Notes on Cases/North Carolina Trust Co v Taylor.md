SUMMARY: Trustees under a revocable trust agreement are seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the trust agreement and its construction. Guardians ad litem were appointed to the lineal descendants relevant to the trust.

THEORY: Opinion is very bare regarding the facts of the case, making it hard to develop a theory as to why the case was designated. Designation may have been the result of the presence of the appointed guardian ad litems, otherwise it could be because of the complicated nature of trust agreements but if that were the case one would think there would be more emphasis on the facts of the case in the opinion.

495: “On 11 July 2007, the Chief Justice designated both cases as “exceptional” cases pursuant to [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I88a85684393f11de9988d233d23fe599&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2c908a9a46ad4675a187639b68ba0e71&contextData=(sc.Search)) (2007).”

Plaintiff-Appellants Brief 2008 WL 2229329: “On June 4, 2007, Reese filed a Motion for Designation of Action as a “Complex Business Case” pursuant to Rule 2.1, and served a copy thereof on City and County. On June 11, 2007, Reese filed a Supplement to Motion for Designation of Action as a “Complex Business Case” pursuant to Rule 2.1, and served a copy thereof on City and County. On June 15, 2007, City and County filed and served upon Reese Defendants' Response to Plaintiff's Request for Rule 2.1 Designation.” … “On July 11, 2007, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina issued an Order designating this action as exceptional under Rule 2.1 and assigned the case to the Honorable Lindsay R. Davis, Jr., Superior Court Judge (hereinafter, “Judge Davis”) for hearing and disposition.”

SUMMARY: Plaintiff Taxpayer Reese brought this action claiming that Defendant City and County Charlotte unlawfully entered and completed an interlocal agreement, meaning the Park acquisition was invalid. Plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief. 

THEORY: Seems to be the same factual/legal issue as the last case. If so, it is likely this case has been designated for the same reasons as the last case (Reese v. Board). See the last case for analysis.

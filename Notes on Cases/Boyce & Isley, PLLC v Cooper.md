SUMMARY: Plaintiff Boyce & Isley and Boyce as an individual brought suit against Cooper, his campaign committee, and his campaign staff. Plaintiff alleges defamation and unfair trade practices following a television campaign advertisement that aired during the 2000 election for NC Attorney General. 

THEORY: The Motion for Rule 2.1 Exceptional Judge suggests that designation is the result of a need for judicial efficiency and the want for a consistent ruling that will stand in the future. Whether the case was actually designated under these factors is unclear.

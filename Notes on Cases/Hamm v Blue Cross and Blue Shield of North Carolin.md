SUMMARY: Plaintiff (and noted as on behalf of others similarly situated) sued BCBS on four causes of action. Plaintiff is suing because a plan they took out with BCBS for health insurance and once reaching the plan maximum, they were charged a price that is higher than the plan price they expected to pay.

THEORY: I believe this case was designated as a result of the diverse interests represented by the Plaintiff through the Class Status attempt. The case could also be designated as a result of complicated matters of law but it seems much less likely. (number/diverse interests of parties)

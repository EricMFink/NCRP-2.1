SUMMARY: Plaintiff is bringing an action against the title insurance company alleging that certain fees are part of deceptive trade practices and now seeks class certification.

THEORY: Plaintiff is bringing this action seeking class certification. Because Plaintiff represents the interests of a larger number of people other than themselves and their own interests, I believe this case was designated because of the differing interests of multiple plaintiffs. (number/diverse interests of parties)

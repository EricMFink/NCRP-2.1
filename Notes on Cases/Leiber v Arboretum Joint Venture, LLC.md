SUMMARY: Plaintiff invested money through Spreti (who was an investor of some of the Defendants) Spreti then, somehow (unclear), invested Plaintiff’s money in Defendants. Plaintiff had a number of documents created for these investments. Plaintiff only received a portion of the expected amount from Spreti, and also poorly managed his own investments in Defendants. Properties were given to Defendants, Plaintiff alleges that Spreti forged Plaintiff’s signature of approval on the properties. Spreti is now unavailable on account of the fact that he committed suicide the day before he was set to meet with Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff’s investments. 

THEORY: There are many defendants all conglomerated into AAC Entities (number/diverse interests of parties). I feel the absence of Spreti could have resulted in complicated pre-trial proceedings/motions but nothing in the filings suggests that suing the AAC Entities is a burden greater than suing Spreti.

Brief of Appellee 2020 WL 4606679: The Rule 2.1 Designation. In November 2018, the parties jointly moved to have the entire group of cases designated exceptional under [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=If3284652dc3d11eab1faf5a0aee61ce8&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5d83dc09713f4d3297df5e96b469df8b&contextData=(sc.RelatedInfo)). R p. 191. Appellants expressly consented both to the designation and to assignment of the case to Judge Bell. *See id.* Chief Justice Mark Martin granted the motion on 7 December 2018.

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Plaintiffs are borrowers who have mortgages with Bank of America. Plaintiffs sought modification of their mortgages through HAMP but all were eventually foreclosed upon after their HAMP claims were not completed with Defendant or were denied by Defendant. Plaintiffs are alleging fraud. 

THEORY: Because there are several hundred claims against Bank of America, claims were consolidated under the designation (NOT ALL THE CLAIMS WERE DESIGNATED, plaintiff appellant’s brief 2020 WL 3078228). I believe it to be likely that this case was designated for the efficient administration of justice, but also for the complicated factual/legal matters involved.

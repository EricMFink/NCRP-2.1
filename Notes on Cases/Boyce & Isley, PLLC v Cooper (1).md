Motion for Rule 2.1 Exceptional Judge… 2003 WL 25855711: In relevant part, this motion argues that the Defendant’s motion to further delay should be denied. It also argues that what the case needs is “a single, readily available, experienced Superior Court judge”

No Analysis of Factors for Rule 2.1, The Motion for Rule 2.1 Judge is very bare bones

SUMMARY: Underlying case of this appeal is based on Plaintiff Boyce & Isley (a firm) bringing action against Defendant Cooper. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant published a false/fraudulent political advertisement about Boyce (as a person) and Boyce & Isley (the firm) during the 2000 campaign for NC Attorney General. 

THEORY: The Motion for Rule 2.1 Exceptional Judge suggests that designation is the result of a need for judicial efficiency and the want for a consistent ruling that will stand in the future. Whether the case was actually designated under these factors is unclear.

SUMMARY: Result of a settlement coming from “*Joan M. Faulkner and John Faulkner v. Health Management Associates, Inc.; Louisburg H. M.A., Inc. d/b/a Franklin Regional Medical Center; Steven Schwam, M.D.; Lemuel Yerby M.D. and Triangle Surgical Associates, P.A.,* Franklin County File No. 03 CVS 271” The Plaintiffs are seeking contribution and indemnification and argue unjust enrichment in this civil action. On issue now is whether the summary judgment motion should be granted.  

THEORY: Unsure about the connection to the prior suit (the Faulkner Lawsuit) and whether that had any part in the subsequent action being designated. There might be an argument for complicated pre trial motions/proceedings.

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Citizens are bringing an action against the State Board of Elections saying there is an issue with the constitutionality of the drawing of the superior court districts in Wake County. Plaintiffs argue the drawing as stands violates the Equal Protection Clause of the NC State Constitution. See also: 681 S.E.2d 759, 762

THEORY: Bartlett, as representative of the State Board of Elections, is in this action as Defendant for the State Board. As the State Board is a government/government adjacent agency, it may have promoted the designation in search of the efficient administration of justice. This case also could have been designated because of the large amount of people in Wake County that the Plaintiffs represent by bringing this claim (number/diverse interests of parties).

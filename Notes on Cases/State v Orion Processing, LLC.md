SUMMARY: Orion offered illegal debt adjusting services to customers in N.C. and held itself out as providing legal services/representation. In the end, customers were left with their debts unsettled and other creditors were unpaid. (Same as State ex rel. Cooper v. Orion Processing, LLC)

THEORY: Designated because of the number of people effected (number/diverse interests of parties), extensive pre-trial discovery/motions, and/or the complex matter of debtor suits.

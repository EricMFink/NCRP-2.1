SUMMARY: Third Party Plaintiff Jackson entered into agreements with Third Party Defendant CWS and Home Depot for a water treatment system. They created a purchase agreement with CWS and an installation agreement with Home Depot. Jackson then entered into a Card Agreement with Citibank to open a Home Depot credit card. This card agreement had an arbitration clause. There was an unpaid balance on the credit card and Citibank sued to recover the amount. Jackson brought class action counterclaim against Citibank and then third party class action claims against CWS and Home Depot.

THEORY: I believe this case was designated in anticipation of complicated evidence as well as the complicated pre-trial proceedings/motions.

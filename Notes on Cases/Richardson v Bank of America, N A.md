No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Plaintiff Borrowers brought a class action against Defendant Bank of America and its subsidiary. Defendant and subsidiary sold single-premium credit insurance in association with mortgage loans. Plaintiff Borrowers allege unfair and deceptive trade practices, unjust enrichment, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiff Borrowers seek punitive damages.

THEORY: This case was designated through a joint motion of the parties. The motion is not on Westlaw. The opinion does state that there was extensive discovery. As a result, the case may have been designated in anticipation of the discovery. Additionally, there is a comment in the Petition for Discretionary Review… about the Defendants consenting to jurisdiction. This may be suggesting that there was a waiver of venue, it is very unclear but was put in the Petition for a reason.

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: EBW Debtors sought relief under ch 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, was then transformed into a ch 7 relief, then the principals and officers of the Debtors filed a civil action which was removed to federal district court and then dismissed under the Barton Doctrine. Trustee moved for relief because of the dismissal of the civil action through the Barton Doctrine.

THEORY: Designated because of complicated pre-trial motions/proceedings. I think this is the case not only because of the Barton Doctrine removal, but also because bankruptcy proceedings tend to be complicated.

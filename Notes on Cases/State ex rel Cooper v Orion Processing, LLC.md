SUMMARY: Orion offered illegal debt adjusting services to customers in N.C. and held itself out as providing legal services/representation. In the end, customers were left with their debts unsettled and other creditors were unpaid.

THEORY: Designated because of the complicated debtor proceedings, the business court rules and procedure under Rule 2.1 would promote clarity in the pre-trial motions/proceedings

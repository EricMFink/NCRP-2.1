No Relevant Filings Cite Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Plaintiff alleges 15 separate claims, Defendant alleges 9 counterclaims. Plaintiff and Defendant entered an MOU to employ Smith for the benefit of the Lewis’ business. The Lewis’s sought to have Smith removed as a 1/3 manager of the Defendant Companies. Smith decided to resign as there was no final agreement made regarding his compensation for time with the Defendant’s business. 

No Record Available on Westlaw

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

THEORY: I think this case was designated because it has a complex back-and-forth of claims, with over 20 total claims in the suit. I also think the MOU and the interest Plaintiff held in the business create a complicated business matter worthy of designation.

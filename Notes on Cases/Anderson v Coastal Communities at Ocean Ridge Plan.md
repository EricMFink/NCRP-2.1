SUMMARY: Designated as a mandatory complex business case under 7A-45.4.. Rule 2.1 is cited because of subsection b saying how a judge should be assigned to a case designated as a mandatory complex business case. Plaintiffs bring a total of 21 claims against multiple Defendants in this suit. Plaintiffs, home/land buyers, are claiming Defendants, sellers/companies/agents, created a scheme to and concealed their conduct which was designed to artificially inflate the market. 

No Record Available

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

THEORY: Designated as mandatory complex business case. Unclear as to why designated as such. If designating under Rule 2.1 and not 7A-45.4 the case would likely be designated because of complicated proceedings (a combination of the claims and number of plaintiffs) to promote judicial efficiency. An argument may also be made that the case could be designated as a result of the various different interests the Plaintiffs represent and such a designation would help properly address those interests. Opposition to this would be that the Plaintiffs have such similar legal and factual issues that their interests could be protected without designation.

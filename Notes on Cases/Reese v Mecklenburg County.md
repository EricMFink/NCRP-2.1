Plaintiff Appellant’s Brief 2009 WL 318905: “On March 26, 2008, Defendants filed a Motion for Designation of Case as “Exceptional” under Rule 2.1 of the General Practice Rules.” … “On April 7, 2008, the honorable Sarah Parker, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, issued an Order designating this action as exceptional under Rule 2.1 and assigned the case to the Honorable W. David Lee, Superior Court Judge (hereinafter, “Judge Lee”) for hearing and disposition.”

SUMMARY: Reese brings an action against Mecklenburg County seeking injunctive relief and declaration that the lease agreement between the County and other defendant Knights Baseball LLC which allowed the team to build a baseball field on the land is void.

THEORY: Plaintiff, while bringing this action alone, is bringing the action on behalf of the “taxpayers and citizens of Mecklenburg County” Because of this, I think designation may be in part the result of Plaintiff representing the many diverse interests of the other people within Mecklenburg County (number/diverse interests of parties). I also think designation may be the result of one of the Defendants being a County. Previously government/government adjacent agencies being parties to an action have been able to have the case designated, that might also be the case if a County is party to an action.

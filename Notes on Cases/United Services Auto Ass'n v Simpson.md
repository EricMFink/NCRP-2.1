SUMMARY: Kaplans filed an action against the ProLife Action League of Greensboro for picketing in front of Kaplans’ business and home. (See *****************************Kaplan v. Prolife Action League of Greensboro*****************************). Simpson is one of those sued in conjunction with Prolife Action League. Plaintiff United Service Automobile Association filed this action against Simpson seeking a declaratory judgment that the insurance policies extended to Simpson do not cover the tort actions the Kaplans filed against Defendant Simpson.

THEORY: It seems that this case was designated as a result of its connection with *********************************************Kaplan v. Prolife Action League of Greensboro*********************************************. That case was assigned to Judge Ross to attend to business necessary for the orderly disposition of the case(s), it seems that the current case, as an extention of ******Kaplan******, is included in that designation.

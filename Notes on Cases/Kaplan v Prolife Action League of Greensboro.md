SUMMARY: Kaplans brought this action against Defendant Prolife Action League of Greensboro because Defendants were picketing in front of the Kaplans’ business and family home. Plaintiffs are claiming public and private nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, RICO violations (federal and state), and interference with civil rights. Partial summary judgment was granted by Judge Ross on the NC RICO claim, this appeal focuses on whether the partial summary judgment was properly granted.

THEORY: The original case may have been designated as a result for the need/want of a clear decision on the legal issues involved. However, if speaking specifically to the RICO claims, the case may have been designated because of the complicated factual/legal issues involved with a RICO claim.

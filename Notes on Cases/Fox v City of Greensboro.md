No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: City police officers after indictment (and the acquittal) for accessing government computers filed this action against the city and certain city officials. Plaintiffs allege malicious prosecution, civil conspiracy, and abuse of process. 

THEORY: It is likely that this case was designated because of the complicated evidence and pre trial proceedings evidenced by the prior trials and their inclusion in the filings/history of this case. Additionally, it might be possible that because this case involved the City Police that the case was designated to promote the efficient administration of justice.

SUMMARY: Plaintiff submitted 15 claims, Defendants submitted multiple answers and crossclaims, including to Intracoastal. (This is the same Superior and Intracoastal as the previous 2 cases). Superior and Intracoastal entered into a contract with RJM for work on Building 5. RJM submitted an invoice, but was never paid.

THEORY: I feel this is very similar to the Miller & Long v Intracoastal Living case. While the facts for these specific claims are much more straightforward, the larger picture which includes the Miller & Long case creates a much more complicated factual web which I believe sparked designation.

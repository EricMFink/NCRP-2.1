**491**: “On 3 April 2007, counsel for Defendants wrote to Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Robert P. Johnston, requesting that the case be designated as an “ ‘exceptional’ case” pursuant to “[Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I657799f4ef5111deb08de1b7506ad85b&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=65f38aae8fd845689826ecf75ad5e7a9&contextData=(sc.Search))” and that the case be assigned to Judge Ervin.” … “On 14 May 2007, Supreme Court Chief Justice Sarah (**492)** Parker entered an order designating this action as “*exceptional* ” and assigned the case to Judge Diaz.”

**Defendant-Appellee’s Brief 2008 WL 4143900:** Assignment of a case to a judge under Rule 2.1 grants that judge the power to revisit pre-assignment rulings. (R. p 1372). Footnoe 4-14 are from this brief.

**Footnote 4: “**After Defendants sought to designate the case as “exceptional” pursuant to Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice (R pp. 861-62), Wachovia objected to Judge Ervin's continued service as judge on this matter. (R pp. 863-64)” Because Ervin had recently bought stock involved in the case. 

**********************Footnote 7:********************** Wachovia wants a De Novo standard of review but only cites one case in support ([Dublin v. UCR, Inc., 115 N.C. App. 209, 220, 444 S.E.2d 455, 461-62 (1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1994135214&pubNum=711&originatingDoc=I8da97d497ead11ddbc7bf97f340af743&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_461&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=748b9ab2396945ce87093d7c89083c4f&contextData=(sc.RelatedInfo)#co_pp_sp_711_461). (App. Br. at 12)) but the case is not a Rule 2.1 case. 

**************************Footnote 14:************************** “Wachovia argues that the designation of this case as “exceptional” pursuant to Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice exempts it from the Business Court Rules. (App. Br. at 16) This ignores the Case Management Order's express adoption of the Business Court Rules (R pp. 928-36), as well as Wachovia's own assertion that the “Business Court systems, rules, and procedures are well designed and suited to handling this case.” (R p. 864)…”

**Plaintiff-Appellant’s Brief 2008 WL 2964816:** “On 9 May 2007, Chief Justice Parker designated this action “exceptional” pursuant to General Rule of Practice 2.1(a)(a) and assigned it to Judge Albert Diaz.” Footnote 5 is from this Brief.

**************************Footnote 5: “**************************This action was assigned to Judge Diaz under General Rule of Practice 2.1(a)(a) as an exceptional case not as a complex business case. (R p. 881) Thus, Judge Diaz's questions about his possible authority to overrule Judge Ervin because of his role as a Business Court Judge, articulated in his Order, are not pertinent here. (R p. 1372)”

**Defendant’s Brief in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion… 2007 WL 2398701: “**At that point, however, Plaintiffs apparently had a change of heart regarding Judge Ervin, ostensibly based on his holdings of Wachovia stock, and successfully sought to disqualify him as a possible Rule 2.1 Judge to handle the remainder of the case. An expedited scheduling order was thus never entered, and could not be entered until appointment of a Rule 2.1 Judge by the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.”

**Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of Motion… 2007 WL 1971876:** “At the hearing when he granted the preliminary injunction in this action (prior to the Rule 2.1 assignment), Judge Ervin directed that the parties proceed with jurisdictional discovery.”

ANALYSIS: When a judge has an invested interest in the case, parties can have the case reassigned to a different judge. Either party can do this, or waive the ability. Here, Plaintiff Wachovia initially waived/did not care about Judge Ervin having stock in Wachovia when the case was assigned to him under Defendant’s motion. Plaintiff then decided that they wanted the case reassigned, no express reason is stated but Defendant’s speculate the reassignment is because of Ervin’s stock in Wachovia. When a case is designated as “exceptional” and not as a “complex business case” the rules of the Business Court can still be used if there is a Case Management Order saying that the case will be following the Business Court Rules. Assignment of a case under Rule 2.1 also grants the assigned judge the power to review pre-assignment rulings.

SUMMARY: Wachovia is bringing an action against Harbinger Capital Partners as a hedge fund and managing agent of funds asserting claims for champerty and maintenance, unfair/deceptive trade practices, and indemnity. Wachovia sought a declaration that Defendants could not assert previously purchased tort claims.  

THEORY: I wonder why this case was not designated as a complex business case and is rather designated as exceptional. My guess is that, even though the parties involved are businesses, one of the main issues is the attempted barring of Defendant’s tort claims. But even then, the Defendants purchased the interest in the tort claims. I think this case was designated in part to have a clear decision regarding the power Rule 2.1 grants assigned judges. Complicated pre-trial and pre-assignment proceedings may have also motivated designation.

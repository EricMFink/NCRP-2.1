No Analysis of Rule 2.1

THEORY: Designated because of complicated pre-trial proceedings. I believe this case was designated for that reason because of multiple claims/counterclaims and consent orders being filed during the pre-trial stage, as well as the existence of an election for new members of the Meherrin Indian Tribal Counsel taking place during the pre-trial stage giving rise to another claim from the Plaintiffs.

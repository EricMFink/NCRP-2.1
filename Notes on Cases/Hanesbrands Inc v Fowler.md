# Hanesbrands Inc. v. Fowler

Cite: 794 S.E.2d 497, 500+
Court: N.C.
Issued Date: Dec. 21, 2016
Reviewed: Yes

500, 

Issue: Defendant argues that the designation of her case (under mandatory designation as a complex business case) affects a substantial right. The right she is arguing would be denied is the right to “have this matter heard in the same manner as ordinary disputes involving ordinary citizens.” 

Holding: Defendant does not show how she would be prejudiced by the designation of her case and its hearing in the Business Court. She also does not identify a specific material right that she would lose if review of the order is not complete before final judgment.

ANALYSIS: Even if the case is not designated as a mandatory complex business case, the case could be designated under Rule 2.1. The NC Supreme Court cites the Delaware law on the issue where a case CANNOT be designated if about a “…choice of court agreement…where the agreement relates to an individual or collective contract of employment.” NC does not have such an exclusion. Additionally, the court decides that a preference for another forum, other than the Business Court, absent a reason for exclusion from destination does not allow the Defendant to immediate appeal on the basis of a venue change.

No relevant filings cite Rule 2.1

THEORY: Case was designated as a mandatory complex business case, so that’s what the analysis mostly focuses on, but I think the 2.1 analysis is still good and relevant. Since designation was as a mandatory complex business case under N.C.G.S. 7A-45, the Rule 2.1 factors were not applied.

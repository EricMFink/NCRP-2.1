739: “The same day (Nov. 9, 2017), the case was designated as exceptional under [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I0017168025ee11ec91fff72264cfd314&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b84aa765cfb34d3f8a2b4798faee316b&contextData=(sc.Search)).”

Defendants’ joining brief in opposition… 2019 WL 10255511: principle that “ordinarily one judge may not modify, overrule, or change the judgment of another Superior Court judge previously made in the same action.” does not apply because of the 2.1 designation

Appellant-Defendant 2020 WL 5360117: in Record. p. 81 (same in Defendants-Appellants 2020 WL 5360116)

No Record on Westlaw

Analysis: No analysis on why the designation/factors. Gives information regarding precedent (See highlighting above)

SUMMARY: Voters brought a libel action against election personnel. Plaintiffs are claiming the election personnel made defamatory statements including alleging that voters had double-voted. Defendants argue that the trial court erred in determining that the Defendants were not entitled to the protection of absolute privilege. 

THEORY: I believe this case may have been designated because of the complex nature of the evidence involved. I also think that this case could be an example of designation as a result of other matters the Chief Justice would deem appropriate as elections and the possibility of election fraud is a serious social issue with a large impact on the government which may have motivated the Chief Justice to designate.

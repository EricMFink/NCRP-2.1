No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Inmates in DPS custody have brought a class action against DPS. The class attempts to represent inmates who were/would be subjected to solitary confinement and that DPS policies violated the State Constitution. The issue is whether the trial court properly denied the class certification on the basis of failure to identify a predominate common issue.

THEORY: It is possible this case was designated for complexity of legal issues or to promote efficient administration of justice. Considering that the outcome of the case would effect DPS policy and procedure it is likely that designation would push the case forward quicker and allow for the efficient administration of justice/promote judicial efficiency.

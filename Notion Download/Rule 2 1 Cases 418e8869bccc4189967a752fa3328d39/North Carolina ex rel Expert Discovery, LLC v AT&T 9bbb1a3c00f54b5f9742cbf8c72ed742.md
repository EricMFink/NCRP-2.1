No Record on Westlaw, Consent Motion not available on Westlaw

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Plaintiff is bringing an action against telecommunication companies alleging that they violated the NC False Claims Act through the knowing failure to remit 911 service charges.

THEORY: Assuming that because it's a consent motion, both parties agreed to designate as exceptional. The cause may have been designated as a result of the number and diverse interests of parties considering that Plaintiff is suing on behalf of NC as a state. Designation also came after Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed claims against Frontier Parent Company and Subsidiaries, could have been designated for complicated pre-trial motions AND/OR to promote the efficient administration of justice.

ANALYSIS: Designation is result of complex evidentiary and legal issues of the case and amount of anticipated pretrial discovery. In holding, court finds that seeking a Rule 2.1 designation on the part of the Plaintiff is in opposition to arbitration and is, in fact, a step in litigation. 

SUMMARY: Plaintiff entered contract with Defendant to revitalize Belville, NC. Town bringing action against developer for breach of contract/nonperformance/anticipatory repudiation/wrongful interference with contract/etc… 

THEORY: We know what factor this was designated under. Part of the complex issues/evidence is the avoidance of arbitration and the large-scale manner of the attempted revitalization.

No relevant filings cite Rule 2.1, weird because there is 51 filings

No Record on Westlaw

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Plaintiffs filed suit against various Defendants with 17 claims for relief, of which they make multiple amendments. A portion of the claims were designated as mandatory complex business cases, others were designated under Rule 2.1. Following this, some of the claims were combined because they contained similar questions of law and fact. 

THEORY: Possibly designated for judicial efficiency because of the multiple claims for relief and the similarity in law/fact issues within those claims.

SUMMARY: Superior entered a contract with Intracoastal Living for the construction of multiple buildings. Superior then entered a subcontracting agreement with Miller & Long, the agreement for Building 4 was created but not signed by the parties. Disputes developed as construction and bidding on other Buildings continued. Miller sued Intracoastal, Superior, and others for issues arising out of performing the contract. 

THEORY: I think this would all under Rule 2.1 because of the complex evidentiary matters involved. The subcontracting agreements and continued bidding create a dynamic fact pattern that requires a deep dive into business law and practical applications.

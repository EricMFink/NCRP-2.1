No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Tenants are bringing a putative class action against property manager/defendant Blue Ridge Companies, Inc. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant violated NCRRAA and NCDRA. The primary issue is whether the trial court erred in designating the classes as requested by Plaintiffs.

THEORY: This is one of many class actions to be designated as exceptional. This makes me think that a case being filed as a class action is a factor that is not explicitly listed. This may fall under the factor of “number and diverse interests of parties”

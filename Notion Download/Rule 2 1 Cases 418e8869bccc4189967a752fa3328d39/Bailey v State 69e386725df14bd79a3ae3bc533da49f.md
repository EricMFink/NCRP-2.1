SUMMARY: Former government employees (retired) are bringing a class action against the state challenging the constitutionality of a legislative tax exemption cap on the retired employees’ retirement benefits. 

THEORY: Off the bat, the main factor for designation seems to be the diverse/numerous interests of the parties. Otherwise, it is a class action, which may fall under the “diverse interests” factor but is unclear whether it counts there and not as an element of the case suggesting/supporting designation without being a factor. Additionally in that vein, this is a case involving a government/government-adjacent agency which has in prior cases been a common fact in designated cases. It is possible that this would fall under the factor of promoting the efficient administration of justice.

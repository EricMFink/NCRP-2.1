SUMMARY: Plaintiff Harco filed suit against Defendant Grant Thornton in response to GT’s audit of CBC’s balance sheets. CBC is a company that deals with bail and immigration bonds but is not a company that is licensed to sell bonds as an insurance company. Harco entered a fronting agreement with CBC. GT then performed audits on CBC by accountants licensed in PA, not in IL. This is relevant because Harco and GT are IL organizations. The issue arises because Harco wants NC law applied and GT wants IL law applied. 

THEORY: I think this may be a case that was designated because of the complicated legal issue. Choice of law is an important issue that needs a clear answer for the case at issue and for future cases. Because this case is about choice of law, I think the need for a clear answer to the legal issue was the reason for designation. This may fall under complex legal issues OR the need for judicial efficiency.

SUMMARY: Intracoastal entered into a construction agreement with Superior. On the first contract (it was a series for the whole condominium), Western issued a payment bond. To secure a loan from Wachovia to Intracoastal, Intracoastal delivered a construction loan agreement to Wachovia. Superior filed a claim of lien on Condominium Project Property, during this time Superior filed “Partial Waiver of Lien” documents. The amounts in the Waiver were funded by Wachovia. Wachovia brought action to seek judicial determination that their claim of lien is prior to Superior’s.

THEORY: Like *************Miller & Long************* and ************RJM Plumbing************, I think this case was designated as result of the complicated facts involved. However, as this incident becomes larger and larger with more cases, I feel the designation may be a result of a need for judicial efficiency and consistent judgment on the issues.

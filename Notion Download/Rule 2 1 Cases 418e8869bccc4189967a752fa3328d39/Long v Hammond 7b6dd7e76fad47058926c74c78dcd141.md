SUMMARY: Insurance Commissioner is bringing an action against an agent seeking to recover a civil penalty for the marketing of coverage to a self-insured fund that did not have license to practice in the state. 

THEORY: This case is part of a larger case web which were all designated as exceptional. Because of this large case nexus, I believe that the cases were designated to promote judicial efficiency and consistency in judgment.

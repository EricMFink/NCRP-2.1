2: “These time limitations do not apply when a party seeks a “discretionary” request from the senior resident superior court judge to the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court under [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=Ie0c8bf7bcf2511e5b4bafa136b480ad2&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=964d2d17ad1e4899aa0399404c5b57b9&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)) (“General Rules” or “Rule(s)”). Further, a mandatory designation lies only for cases that involve material issues within the defined categories specified in [section 7A–45.4](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000037&cite=NCSTS7A-45.4&originatingDoc=Ie0c8bf7bcf2511e5b4bafa136b480ad2&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=964d2d17ad1e4899aa0399404c5b57b9&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)). A case may qualify for discretionary assignment to the Business Court under [Rule 2.1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=Ie0c8bf7bcf2511e5b4bafa136b480ad2&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=964d2d17ad1e4899aa0399404c5b57b9&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)) if the case does not qualify for mandatory designation under the statute but involves certain other factors. *See, e.g.,* BCR 3.2.” (The statutory time limits for Sec. 7A-45.4 do not apply to Rule 2.1 Designations, and if a case is not designated under 7A-45.4, then it may be designated under Rule 2.1)

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: CFA sued Defendant over “Agreement” where Defendant was supposed to introduce CFA to customers and in return Defendant got royalties from CFA. Disagreement arose over what customers to pay a commission on.

THEORY: Even though the case was designated as a mandatory complex business case, it might still achieve designation under Rule 2.1 because of the complicated legal issues and evidence involved.

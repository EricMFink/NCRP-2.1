No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Members of TSERS, the Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System, filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that an executive order that required state employees to deposit TSERS contributions into an escrow account violated the state constitutional provision for the protection of TSERS funds and also seeking a writ of mandamus to require penalties for state employees for default in remitting contributions to TSERS. The suit was in response to an executive order from the Governor ordering the contributions to an escrow account.

THEORY: Seems this case was designated as a result of “substantial discovery” referenced in the opinion. While a case can be designated on expected extensive discovery, other characteristics in this case that may have motivated designation include the class certification and presence of the State as a party. Throughout the previous cases, if there is a government/government adjacent agency present as a party or there is class certification, it seems to correlate with designation. If not, this case may have been designated as a way to promote judicial efficiency (for the benefit of the State) or diverse interests of the many parties (class certification).

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: The issue is whether this action can be considered a class action. Plaintiff bought an automobile under a “no cash down” promotion but claims that Defendant used deceptive trade practices and violated such promotion.

THEORY: Attempts at class action status may have motivated designation because of either/both complicated pretrial proceedings/motions or because of the large number of plaintiffs and their diverse interests (number/diverse interests of parties).

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Plaintiff was the director of a research program but then got offered an ownership position with Defendant Momentum. Momentum’s officers created “The Resolution” determining how shares could be offered/sold, including those to Plaintiff. Directors of Momentum then offered and rescinded the offer to Plaintiff. Through employment, Plaintiff also signed a Shareholder’s Agreement but is unable to locate the document. Momentum says the alleged Shareholder’s Agreement does not exist.

THEORY: This case was designated as a complex business case under 7A-45.4. However, if it were to be designated under Rule 2.1, I believe it would be a result of the complications over whether Delaware law should apply as Momentum is a Delaware Corporation. (In this case, Defendant wants the Delaware law and Plaintiff wants the NC law) This question is not addressed as it is unnecessary to determine when considering a Summary Judgment Motion.

SUMMARY: This action comes from an alleged breach of a professional service agreement. Plaintiff Vizant is a company that helps reduce the costs associated with financial payments. YRC is the defendant parent corporation of freight companies. After a breakdown of communication between the two parties, Defendant YRC sent Plaintiff Vizant a written notice of termination. Plaintiff seeks damages for the breach of the PSA.

THEORY: There are a series of pre trial motions involved as well as a significant amount of evidence spanning several years. It is likely that this contributed to designation.

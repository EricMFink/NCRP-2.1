# Vance Const. Co., Inc. v. Duane White Land Corp.

Cite: 490 S.E.2d 588, 588+
Court: N.C.App.
Issued Date: Oct. 07, 1997
Reviewed: Yes

590: “The instant case had not been designated as exceptional with Judge Brown assigned to hear the same pursuant to [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I7de069e0037f11dab386b232635db992&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=12ebc72208b543659b8120a95c5907bb&contextData=(sc.Search)). Because Judge Brown had no commission from the Chief Justice or other 
authorization to hold a session of superior court in Warren County or District 9 during the week plaintiff's motion was heard, the order entered is void.”

No Filings

No Record on Westlaw

ANALYSIS: While it seems some instance of this case was designated under Rule 2.1 (see pg 590, not explicit but the phrasing seems to suggest something was designated) the current case was not designated under Rule 2.1 to Judge Brown. This invalidates the actions of the session where the Motion for Relief from Judgment was granted. 

SUMMARY: Plaintiff Vance Construction Company agreed to build a storage facility for Defendant Duane White Land Corporation. Defendant did not pay Plaintiff, resulting in Plaintiff filing this action seeking to recover the payment due. Turns out, Defendant did not pay because of defects in the storage facility and counterclaimed for recovery as a result of these defects. Trial court awarded both parties monetary damages. Following partial payment, Plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment which was granted. Here this court finds that the motion was improperly granted.

THEORY: Still unclear where/when this case was designated because there are no filings related to this case on Westlaw. Based on the facts, I see nothing glaring as to suggest one factor over the others.

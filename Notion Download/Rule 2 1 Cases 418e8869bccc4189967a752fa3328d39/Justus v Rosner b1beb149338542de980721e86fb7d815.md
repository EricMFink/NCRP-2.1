No Analysis of Rule 2.1

THEORY: Designated for judicial efficiency and complicated subject matter needing an expert. Judicial efficiency because there are 27? 25? (unclear) related cases which would be “easier” to adjudicate all at once in the same system. Complicated subject matter because not only did one party die during proceedings (was then represented by the estate) but medical malpractice cases would benefit from a judge familiar with the subject matter.

1: “On June 17, 2010, this case was designated as an exceptional and complex business case pursuant to [Rules 2.1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1006366&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I473093af277c11e2b66bbd5332e2d275&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=875758b4316e4f71acdf53fdf316869f&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)) and [2.2 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.2&originatingDoc=I473093af277c11e2b66bbd5332e2d275&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=875758b4316e4f71acdf53fdf316869f&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)).”

Response to Defendant-Appellant’s Petition for Discretionary Review… 2014 WL 832862: “On 8 June 2010, Plaintiffs, KB Home, and Stock consented to designating this case as an “exceptional” or “complex business case” under Rules 2.1 and 2.2 of the North Carolina General Rules of Practice.”

Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay 2012 WL 1653113: “On June 8, 2010, after KB Home's Motion For Leave to File Third Party Complaint was granted, Plaintiffs, KB Home and Stock *consented to* designating this case as an “exceptional” or “complex business case” under Rules 2.1 and 2.2 of the North Carolina General Rules of Practice.”

SUMMARY: Plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against Defendants alleging 5 claims for relief. All claims come from alleged installation of HardiPlank cement fiber lap siding on Plaintiffs’ homes without a weather resistant barrier behind the HardiPlank but before the walls of the home. Upon further investigation, I determined that HardiPlank has to go above “HardieWrap” which goes against the walls of the home to protect the actual foundational walls of the home. The main issue here is whether a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties. 

No Record Available on Westlaw

No Analysis of Rule 2.1 

THEORY: Probably designated because of complicated pre-trial proceedings/motions. One of the main reasons I believe this is the case is because of the 60 trial court documents/filings available on Westlaw (not including dockets and appellate). I want to note that it seems weird that there are 60 trial court documents/filings but none reference Rule 2.1. I also think the large number of plaintiffs had a role in the designation. Previously I had thought that Class Actions were more likely to become designated, and while that still feels like the case, the ************Bethroth Oil************ case has poked some holes in that idea.

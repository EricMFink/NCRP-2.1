214: “Pursuant to [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I9d756cd60c3511dba224cd6b838f54f9&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=cb54d0c147c74281b4f4ed29a835c3b6&contextData=(sc.Search)), each case related to the walkway collapse was designated an “exceptional” case, and each case was assigned to be heard by Superior Court Judge W. Erwin Spainhour (Judge Spainhour).*”*

215: “…Judge Spainhour adopted certain rulings and liability determinations from prior, consolidated walkway collapse cases, and made those rulings “binding on all similar claims, causes of action or defenses raised in any case which has been assigned to the undersigned Judge pursuant to [Rule 2.1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I9d756cd60c3511dba224cd6b838f54f9&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=cb54d0c147c74281b4f4ed29a835c3b6&contextData=(sc.Search)) ... and is included within the consolidated litigation.” Because the Taylor case was assigned to Judge Spainhour pursuant to [Rule 2.1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I9d756cd60c3511dba224cd6b838f54f9&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=cb54d0c147c74281b4f4ed29a835c3b6&contextData=(sc.Search)) and included within the consolidated litigation, the following liability rulings were incorporated into the Taylor case and therefore are binding on the present cases…”

ANALYSIS: This is an example of other cases in the sphere of influence of the original case being affected by the designation of the original case. Here, from page 215 of the opinion, we see the rules of one case about this collapse being applied to the other Rule 2.1 cases as soon as they are designated.

SUMMARY: Spectators (approx. 100) were injured when part of the walkway at the speedway collapsed. Spectators brought suit claiming negligence and breach of contract. Plaintiffs sued Tindall Corporation, Charlotte Motor Speedway INC, Charlotte Motor Speedway LLC, and Speedway Motorsports INC. Each of the suits against each of the Defendants was designated as exceptional under Rule 2.1

THEORY: It seems likely that this case was designated as a result of the many diverse interests of the plaintiffs seeing as there are over 100 injured spectators who filed suit (number/diverse interests of parties). In addition to that, this seems to be a case with complicated legal matters. I came to this conclusion because of Judge Spainhour making rulings and liability determinations prior to the outcome of this case. None of the other previous cases have mentioned this, making it stand out. This could also point to designation under the need for a clear ruling or judicial efficiency.

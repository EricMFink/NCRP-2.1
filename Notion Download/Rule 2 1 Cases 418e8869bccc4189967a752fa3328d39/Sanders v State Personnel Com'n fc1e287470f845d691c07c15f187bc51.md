No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Workers of state agencies, who were classified as temp workers for more than 12 months, filed this action against the state/state agencies/state officials alleging that as they were employed for more than 12 months they should receive the benefits of permanent employees.

THEORY: The strongest reason for designation would be the number of Plaintiffs (number/diverse interests of parties). However, I would also like to point out that there is a state agency involved as a party. Previously, if one is involved it has led to designation, that may be the case here. Another option might be designation to promote judicial efficiency. A large case such as this, with many plaintiffs and government agencies involved, would likely need to move faster through the judicial system.

SUMMARY: Whether a public utility company can, and if it can to what extent, contractually limit its liability for acts under the filed rate doctrine. Novo has a facility that requires an uninterrupted power supply, for this supply Novo entered into a contract with CP & L. Following a series of outages, Novo and CP&L entered into a Premier Power Services Contract for backup generators. A management contract for the services was also created. An incident occurred where the main power was interrupted and the Facility was run only on the backup generators. The generators malfunctioned and the Facility was then transferred onto the CP&L line after repair. Outages and malfunctions continued. Novo claims CP&L is responsible in tort for the damages caused by the outages.

THEORY: At the time of designation, the parties had completed limited discovery. It is possible the case was designated in anticipation of further complex discovery. The filed rate doctrine may also have motivated designation because of the want for a clear ruling on whether it can be applied and how it applies in this case.

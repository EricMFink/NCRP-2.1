485: “On 11 July 2007, the Chief Justice designated both cases as “exceptional” cases pursuant to [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I88a8085d393f11de9988d233d23fe599&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6f2997c2426844d192b1439772fa34f0&contextData=(sc.Search)) (2007).” 

Plaintiff-Appellant Brief 2008 WL 2229328: “On May 31, 2007, Reese filed a Motion for Designation of Action as a “Complex Business Case” pursuant to Rule 2.1, and served a copy thereof on CMBE and County. On June 11, 2007, Reese filed a Supplement to Motion for Designation of Action as a “Complex Business Case” pursuant to Rule 2.1, and served a copy thereof on CMBE and County. On June 15, 2007, CMBE and County filed and served upon Reese Defendants' Response to Plaintiff's Request for Rule 2.1 Designation.” … “On July 11, 2007, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina issued an Order designating this action as exceptional under Rule 2.1 and assigned the case to the Honorable Lindsay R. Davis, Jr., Superior Court Judge (hereinafter, “Judge Davis”) for hearing and disposition.”

Motion for Designation of Action as a “Complex Business” Case Pursuant to Rule 2.1: Gives Multiple Reasons under which the case could have been designated, does not say which one specifically caused designation or which ones had the most weight. 

ANALYSIS: The Motion for Designation argues the case should be designated because of multiple factors. First it argues the dispute has complex legal and factual issues regarding the transaction between Plaintiff and the Board of Education and that some of those issues are novel to the state of North Carolina. Second it argues that the Plaintiff expects extensive discovery and pre trial motions. Third the motion argues that the Plaintiff will require a rigorous evidentiary presentation and that during said presentation issues that rarely see the courts will be produced. In the motion, it goes on to argue that the issues are of relevance to the municipal corporations and other bodies throughout North Carolina and also that the issues/matters of the case are likely to require an expert on the subject. While this is not a listed factor, it may be that it falls into the last factor of things a judge would deem appropriate for designation. The need for expertise is an argument under the judicial efficiency factor. 

SUMMARY: Plaintiff Reese brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the Defendant Board of Education’s received conveyance granting them property. The conveyance to the Board of Education was an attempt to continue development on a mixed-use area. Plaintiff wants to block the conveyance.

SUMMARY: University students (Plaintiffs) from UNC/State are bringing an action against the UNC Board of Governors and NCSU (Defendant collectively). The students allege the Defendant improperly assessed parking fees and improperly retained the funds after campus activities were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

THEORY: It seems likely that this case would have been designated because of the number/diverse interests of the parties considering the students of UNC-CH and NCSU are a large amount of Plaintiffs. The case may have also been designated because of the complexity/amount of evidence and discovery. This is supported on the idea that each of the students would have separate evidence of their funds being improperly retained.

SUMMARY: Defendants/Third Party Plaintiffs Tradewinds filed suit against Third Party Defendants C-S Aviation (and others). Third Party Plaintiffs Tradewinds’ claims against C-S Aviation are for fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, and unfair/deceptive trade practices.

THEORY: This action has complicated trial proceedings, including multiple judgments pending at the time this action was adjudicated and one of the parties (Tradewinds) filing for bankruptcy protections during the proceedings. I think this complicated pre-trial (pre-trial because they happened before this specific action) proceedings and motions caused designation.

Erwin Spainhour. As such, the Hepler suits were designated “exceptional” and assigned to Judge Spainhour.”

Erwin Spainhour. (R p. 4)”

ANALYSIS: This case was designated because of its connection to *************************Kennedy v Speedway Motorsports Inc*************************. Page 799 of the opinion states that the Hepler case was designated because each case related to *******Kennedy******* was designated and assigned to Judge Spainhour. 

SUMMARY: Coming from the same incident as **********************************Kennedy v Speedway Motorsports Inc**********************************, this case involves a suit after the racetrack and company were found liable for the pedestrian injuries but before individual trials to determine injury compensation. The company who built the walkway filed a motion for sanctions and a motion to compel production of certain items against Pedestrian (Plaintiff Hepler) who filed an action on behalf of the estate of her husband (Drew Hepler who died after the collapse, possibly because of the collapse).

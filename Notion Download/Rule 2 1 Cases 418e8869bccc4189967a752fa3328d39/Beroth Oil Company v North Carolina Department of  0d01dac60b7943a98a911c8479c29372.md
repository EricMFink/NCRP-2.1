**494:** “On 31 July 2012, the Chief Justice certified plaintiffs’ cases as “exceptional” under [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=I5a572530cee611e7b393b8b5a0417f3d&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=18a038de5af047088d1047c85ed2a84d&contextData=(sc.Search)), and the trial court subsequently consolidated plaintiffs into the same group for case management purposes.”

**Defendant-Appellee’s New Brief 2013 WL 1901068:** “Efficient means of litigating multiple claims and parties involving the Northern Beltway already exist. Chief Justice Parker entered orders on 31 July and 21 November 2012 designating 52 individual cases (11-CVS-7119, *et al;* 11-CVS-5953, *et al*) that were filed against NCDOT involving the Northern Beltway (and nearly identical claims) as “exceptional” under [Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=Id96e31fbb7fe11e2a98ec867961a22de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3f71cef672934192ba72b7b4314f547d&contextData=(sc.RelatedInfo)) for Superior and District Courts. The Chief Justice assigned the cases to Resident Superior Court Judge John O. Craig, III, for resolution.[3](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Id96e31fbb7fe11e2a98ec867961a22de/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=%2FRelatedInfo%2Fv4%2Fkeycite%2Fnav%2F%3Fguid%3DId96e31fbb7fe11e2a98ec867961a22de%26srh%3D%26kw%3Dt&listSource=RelatedInfo&list=Filings&rank=1&docFamilyGuid=Id96e31fcb7fe11e2a98ec867961a22de&ppcid=e19415b4c9004da3b748458d57773b5a&originationContext=filings&transitionType=FilingsItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29#co_tablefootnoteblock_3) App. A, p. 1. Counsel for Appellants also represent the litigants in the [Rule 2.1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=Id96e31fbb7fe11e2a98ec867961a22de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3f71cef672934192ba72b7b4314f547d&contextData=(sc.RelatedInfo)) cases. In short, Appellants' counsel agreed that the [Rule 2.1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=Id96e31fbb7fe11e2a98ec867961a22de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3f71cef672934192ba72b7b4314f547d&contextData=(sc.RelatedInfo)) designation would “promote significant efficiencies,” “greater certainty of decision-making,” “enhance judicial efficiency,” and “prevent the risk of inconsistent judgments” for these claims. *Id.* These types of cases are manageable under a [Rule 2.1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1008947&cite=NCRSUPDR2.1&originatingDoc=Id96e31fbb7fe11e2a98ec867961a22de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3f71cef672934192ba72b7b4314f547d&contextData=(sc.RelatedInfo)) mechanism.”

**Joint Motion Pursuant to Rule 2.1…** **2014 WL 12726809:** Basis of the motion is because of the complex legal issues (inverse condemnation), the numerous parties (30+ w/ 59+ suits) with similar legal issues, and the rarity of this legal issue (inverse condemnation) needs an expert judge to promote uniformity. (**2014 WL 8508524 and 2014 WL 8508531** are functionally identical) 

ANALYSIS: Parties agreed that designation would support judicial efficiency. Also shows other instances of similar cases being designated for efficiency.

SUMMARY: Landowners brought inverse condemnation action against DOT for recordation of transportation corridor map affecting their properties

No Record available in Westlaw

THEORY: Designated because of the insane number of plaintiffs, thus judicial efficiency or number and diverse interests of parties. Feeling like this is similar to the class-action theory I had earlier. Also bringing action against a government agency may be relevant to this determination

No relevant filings cite Rule 2.1 (odd because there are 52 related filings)

No Record on Westlaw

No Analysis of Rule 2.1

SUMMARY: Plaintiff files claim because Defendant allegedly broke his employment agreement. What ensues is a large dispute over arbitration and many pre-trial motions and amendments which make this case complicated enough to be exceptional.

THEORY: Designated because of the large amount of cases revolving around the same/similar legal issues and facts, creating a large collective amount of Plaintiffs (number/diverse interests of parties). Also says upon proper request it was designated, unfortunately Wake county doesn't have clear rules on Westlaw so I have not been able to determine what is “upon proper request”. I would assume it would be on consent motion as that seems to be common. Even the judge describes the factual and procedural matters complicated because of the consolidation/large amount of cases.

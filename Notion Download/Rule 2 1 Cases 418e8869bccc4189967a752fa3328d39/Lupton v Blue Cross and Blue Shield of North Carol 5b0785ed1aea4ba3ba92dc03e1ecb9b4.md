SUMMARY: Insured filed a class action on behalf of all those similarly situated against BCBS of NC. Insured sought to recover against BCBS for them maintaining an excessive reserve. Court of Appeals holds that the Filed Rate Doctrine precludes Insured’s claim. 

THEORY: This trial is the consolidation of two main cases against BCBS. It is also a class action. This suggests that the case may have been designated as exceptional because of the diverse interests/number of parties and/or judicial efficiency. BCBS is also a large insurance company and the facts may have warranted an judge with expert knowledge in the insurance area.

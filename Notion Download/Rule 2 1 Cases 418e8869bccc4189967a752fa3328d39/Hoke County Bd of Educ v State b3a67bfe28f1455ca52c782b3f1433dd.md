SUMMARY: Various Plaintiff Board of Educations from low-wealth school districts and individual Plaintiffs from the same districts brought an action against the State and the State Board of Education seeking a declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs assert violations of the state constitutional right to equal educational opportunities that arise from the statutory educational funding. 

THEORY: There is a massive amount of Plaintiffs involved, both in a Board representative and then in an individual capacity. This may show evidence of the number/diverse interests of parties factor. It could also point towards designation for judicial efficiency.

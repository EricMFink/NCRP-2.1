SUMMARY: Action was brought against 9 Defendants who manufacture the majority of the EIFS (Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems) within NC and nationally. The case was then certified as a class action. Settlement was reached with Synergy and money was allotted for the affected class. Money was also allotted to counsel for the class. This action is to recover such money for attorney fees and connected expenses.

THEORY: This case has been certified as a class action, and because the defendants provide EIFS for both North Carolina and the Nation on a large scale, it is likely this action is affecting a large number of people. There is no clear direction in the opinion on why the case was designated but it does make a point of saying it happened right after the class designation. This may support the idea that class designation can cause a case to be more likely to be designated as exceptional under Rule 2.1.

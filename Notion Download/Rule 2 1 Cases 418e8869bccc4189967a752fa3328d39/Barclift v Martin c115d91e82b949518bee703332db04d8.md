3: “Prior to the enactment of [Section 7A–45.4(a)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000037&cite=NCSTS7A-45.4&originatingDoc=I07f61550fde711e7b565bb5dd3180177&refType=SP&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9670fb9879cb499b8f171b5c0143556b&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)#co_pp_8b3b0000958a4), the designation process was governed by Rule 2.1 of the General Rule of Practice for the Superior and District Courts…”

Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion in Opposition to Notice of Designation and for Remand: “The interests of justice would be best served by allowing the Plaintiff, who chose the appropriate form and Court for this action, to proceed in his chosen venue. There is nothing complex about the claims against the Defendants. While perhaps every case would benefit from a single judge hearing all matters, that result might be most appropriate by serving an exceptional case designation pursuant to Rule 2.1 of the North Carolina General Rules of Practice. The interests of justice would be better served by remanding this action to the superior Court of Dare County, thereby allowing the North Carolina Business Court to spend its valuable time, resources and expertise on matters specifically related to complex business issues.”

ANALYSIS: Because the parties are filing under Section 7A-45.4(a), the Rule 2.1 Factors need not be analyzed. Plaintiff does not want the case to be designated because they believe the case will be better served (meaning their own interests). Plaintiff does not believe this is an exceptional business matter. The defendant had a unilateral right to designate under Section 7A as a mandatory complex business case because it raised a material dispute over the laws governing corporations.

THEORY: In support of plaintiff (kinda?), it was determined that Section 7A-45.4(a) applies over Rule 2.1. Since Sec. 7A has been applied, and a party did not move for RUle 2.1 designation, the case was NOT designated under Rule 2.1 as the MOD was able to achieve designation under Sec. 7A. It seems like 7A is a way to get around using the Rule 2.1 factors while still getting into a special business court.
